        <p>We've been dating a very long time, and you keep coming back for me every day, but you only have Kingfish sashimi like twice a week, so I would that you probably like me more</p>

        <div><h2>I am a lot of fun, and I am always down for a good time</h2>
        <p>Have you ever seen me turn down an invite to hang out with you? I am ready to party. From scary restaurants in the sky to pubs in the middle of the CBD, I am your guy. First drinks on me (probably)</p>

        <div><h2>We are very cute together</h2>
        <p>Just look at us, we are radiant. I am the worst person at taking pictures, but whenever I'm with you I seem to take my best picture every time. You don't look too bad yourself. I could see me kissing that face every single day for eternity</p>
